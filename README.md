# Armored Glove - A Gauntlet Inspired Dungeon Crawler
Armored Glove will behave similarly to the arcade game Gauntlet, with our own spin and style on it. 
The team plans on completing a game where the party of players explore various levels of a dungeon while attempting to
fight their way to the end. Throughout their adventure, the party will pick up temporary power-ups to aid them in their
quest. Enemies will spawn out of Monster Spawners placed throughout the map. The players must destroy these Monster 
Spawners to stop the flow of monsters. During the journey, keys will need to be picked up to progress through the various
locked doors throughout each level.
